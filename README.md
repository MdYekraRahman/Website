## About Me
----
Hello, I'm Md Yekra Rahman, a graduate from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. My major focus during my undergraduate studies was Electronics, but I have a broad interest in various fields within my sector.

While pursuing my degree, I developed a passion for Data Analysis and Automation. I actively participated in different projects that involved these areas, honing my skills and gaining practical experience. I thoroughly enjoy working with data, extracting insights, and automating processes to optimize efficiency.

During my undergraduate journey, I had the opportunity to work on my Undergraduate Thesis titled "Exploring Mixed Halide Double Perovskites for Solar Cell." Although the thesis primarily focused on searching for core materials, I also incorporated data analysis techniques to predict stability. This project allowed me to combine my knowledge of materials with data-driven approaches, further fueling my interest in the intersection of science and data.

I am excited to continue exploring the realm of Data Analysis and Automation, applying my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges. Feel free to browse through my portfolio and projects to get a glimpse of my work.

Thank you for visiting my webpage!
